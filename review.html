    <p>A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, <br> who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family <br> and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in <br> existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive</p>
    <p>This Dune dwarfs most contemporary sci-fi in its scope and execution, ably juggling multiple characters and settings so that it matches the sprawling drama of the original tome.</p>
